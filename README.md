## Google Drive Restore All

If you've ever need to restore all items from your trash in google drive you may know what a pain it can be (given they only allow you to select 50 files at once). Instead use this script to do it all for you (depending on the amount of files this may take a while): [Script here](./scripts/restore-all.gs)
